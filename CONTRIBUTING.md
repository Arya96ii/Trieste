# Contributing

Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or

# Bugs and patches

We use Github [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/Trieste/issues) to track bugs and features. If you found a bug or want to propose a new feature, please file an issue on our project.

We use Github [pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/Trieste/pulls) for contributions in code, documents, tests, etc.

Every PR must pass the CI builds (which include CLA checks and formatting) and the appropriate set of tests on Windows, Linux (clang & gcc) and Mac, on x86_64. PRs cannot be merged if any of the tests fail.

You are not, however, required to run all these tests on your own, before submitting the PR. Running on at least one of those above and passing should be fine. We can work out the remaining issues during the review process.
